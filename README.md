# Fusée Gelée Launcher for MacOS

This is a simple fork of the ReSwitched team's [fusee-launcher](https://github.com/reswitched/fusee-launcher).

It contains *no payloads*. You must download and place the payloads in the "Payloads" directory.

# Dependencies:

	- Python 3
	- libusb
	- pyusb
(All of these can be installed using ihaveamac's guide [here](https://gbatemp.net/threads/tutorial-for-osx-users.501950/page-2#post-7935127).)

# Usage

1. Look at the top of this repository page
2. Click the green button that says "Clone or download"
3. Download ZIP
4. Find where the ZIP downloaded and extract it
5. In the folder that was extracted place your Fusée payloads in the `Payload` folder.
4. Enter RCM mode on the Switch (this will not be covered here)
5. While in RCM mode, connect the Switch to a USB port on the computer (using a hub will likely *not* work!)
6. Run one of the `.command` files by double-clicking on them.
7. If using `macOS launch.command`, the script will list the available payloads (make sure they're in the `Payloads` folder).
8. Type the name of the payload, including the .bin
